Hodgkin Huxley Model Simulation
===
The [Hodgkin Huxley model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model) is a mathematical model that characterises the action potential propagation of a neuron. The repository contains a simulation of the Hodgkin Huxley model. Done as a part of an assignment for a course on computational neuroscience 

### Functions
1. `freqvscurrent` - plots the firing rate of Action potentials vs the current. Calculates three current thresholds that mark a dyanmic change in behaviour and plots them on to the graph.

2. `hhcell` - plots voltage, gating variables and conductances against time for a specified current input.
