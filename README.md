Hodgkin Huxley Model
===
Functions to plot various parameters of the HH model

### Functions
1. `freqvscurrent` - plots the firing rate of Action potentials vs the current. Calculated three current threshold that mark shift in dynamincal behaviour and adds the marker to the graph.

2. `hhcell` - plots voltage, gating variables and conductances against time for a specified current input.
